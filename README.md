Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that contains information on the passengers who were aboard the ill-fated ship. The dataset contains various features, such as the passenger's age, sex, fare paid, class, and more.

# Results
The script generates the following statistics and insights:

1.Whether fare has missing values and if males are more than women.

2.The ratio of people who survived the crash of the Titanic.

3.The median fare of the passengers.

4.The percentage of women that survived.

5.The percentage of first, second, and third class passengers who survived.

6.The percentage of children who survived.

7.The no of survivors who embarked from Southampton.

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages: pandas and numpy.
Run the script in a Python environment.

# Conclusion
This simple script demonstrates my ability to analyze and gain insights from datasets using Python and Pandas. It showcases my proficiency in data manipulation, missing value imputation, and EDA. The code is well-documented and can be used as a starting point for further analysis.
