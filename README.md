# Exploratory-data-analysis from AI Planet
This was a project at the end of the course about data from the passengers of the titanic including the gender, age, if the person survived, the fare paid and if the person survived
The goal was to see how various factors affected the chance of survival for the passenger such as gender age or even the name of the passenger and whether he/ she was a first-class, second-class or third-class passenger
The chances of survivng according to these factors was then calculated as a percentage and displayed as output.
